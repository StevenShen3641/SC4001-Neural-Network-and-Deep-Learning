    "# Question B2 (10 marks)\n",
    "In Question B1, we used the Category Embedding model. This creates a feedforward neural network in which the categorical features get learnable embeddings. In this question, we will make use of a library called Pytorch-WideDeep. This library makes it easy to work with multimodal deep-learning problems combining images, text, and tables. We will just be utilizing the deeptabular component of this library through the TabMlp network:"
